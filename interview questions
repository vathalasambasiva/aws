What is Metrics Data?
Metrics data refers to numerical data that is collected and recorded over time. It represents quantitative information about the performance or behavior of a system, application, or service. Unlike traditional data that might represent discrete values (e.g., user information or transaction data), metrics data is time-dependent and focuses on tracking performance, resource usage, or other key indicators over time.

Some examples of metrics data include:

CPU usage: How much CPU time a system or process is using over time.
Memory usage: The amount of memory (RAM) a system or application is consuming.
Request count: The number of requests handled by a web server in a given time window.
Response time: The time it takes to process and respond to requests.
Characteristics of Metrics Data in Prometheus:
Time-dependent: Metrics are often timestamped, meaning they are collected at regular intervals or triggered by specific events.
Quantitative: The data typically represents numbers, such as counts, gauges, or histograms.
Tags (Labels): Metrics in Prometheus can have labels, which are key-value pairs that provide more context to the metric (e.g., the application name, environment, or server name).
How Prometheus Stores Metrics Data:
Prometheus stores metrics as time-series. Each time-series consists of a metric name (e.g., http_requests_total) and an optional set of labels that further describe the metric. Prometheus then stores these values as timestamped data pointsâ€”for example, recording the number of HTTP requests served by a web server at specific points in time.

This data can then be queried using Prometheus's query language, PromQL, to generate graphs, monitor system behavior, and set up alerts.





What is main purpose of Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Its primary purpose is to collect metrics from various systems, store them, allow querying and analysis of these metrics, and trigger alerts based on predefined conditions.

How does Prometheus collect metrics?

Prometheus uses a pull-based model, where it scrapes metrics from instrumented targets at regular intervals. Targets expose metrics in a format Prometheus can understand, typically through an HTTP endpoint.
